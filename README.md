# Hangman Update

Going to keep this brief due to SNAFU last night with git and getting about 4 hours sleep last night.

## Day 1

- Basics of the game working. I decided to implement logging. (More on that in a moment.) Just tried to get the basics working. Wrote the code before checking the solution.

## Day 2

- Got stumped on how to compare the two and ended up looking at the solution. Note to self: Come back and practice this problem a bit more.

## Day 3

- This was a relatively easy solution. I did go ahead and fix it to the suggested solution as I think it's a little more scalable for some of the ideas that I plan to try to experiment later.
  Decided given my lack of sleep to call this one a little earlier since I had some other non coding tasks. And frankly, I needed an easy win. Technically, I guess I can code half asleep. :-D Feels a little
  better than it did yesterday. Still... more practice on some of this needed. I don't feel quite as solid as I should.

## Day 4

- This is now MVP status as win/loss conditions and very rudimentary ASCII art are now implemented. There should probably be more words and stuff like art, words, etc should be moved into separate
  modules. But... that's probably some tech debt to clean up and I'll do that once we have some of the other pieces implemented. Feels a little silly to celebrate that I've managed to get through hangman
  and that I'm now at technically a feature complete status, however, I've spent only an hour (sometimes less) each day due toi other commitments. Soo..... not bad for four hours work. I'll probably
  do more before we're said and done. Maybe this is a visit later as technically this isn't the capstone beginner project, but... over engineering things is kinda what I do?

## Day 5

- The product is closer to finished. Greater variety of words to choose from. Still some stuff to clean up, but it's a little cleaner than before. Reminds me... still need to do something about the following:
  - If the user has already guessed a letter AND the letter is already been guessed AND is determined not to be present, don't penalize the player.
- Beyond that, there's a few other niceties that I'd like to add. Probably will be a tomorrow project.
